# Completed task → extract reusable method → **redact** → bucket by workspace → inject into context for future similar tasks.
# (Zleap's three-part memory has Experience: reusable method, redacted, filed by workspace. This repo implements it as files, not a DB.)
#   add  <ws> "<title>" [--from <file>]   store one experience (body from --from or stdin; rejected if redaction fails)
#   list [<ws>]                           list experiences
#   recall <ws> [--query kw] [--limit N]  fetch experiences relevant to this ws (default limit 3, for context injection)
#   show <ws> <slug>                      print one
#   env: FUGUE_EXPERIENCE (default ${FUGUE_STATE:-~/.config/fugue}/experience)
